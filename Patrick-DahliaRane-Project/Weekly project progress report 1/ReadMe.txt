In the initial phase of our PulseHR Employee Management System project, our team's primary focus was on project initiation. This involved establishing the core infrastructure by setting up a conducive development environment and integrating essential technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simultaneously, we dedicated our efforts to crafting a user interface that emphasized user-friendliness and responsiveness. Our overarching objectives encompassed the creation of a robust front-end structure and the seamless navigation experience. Furthermore, we concurrently laid the groundwork for the database and backend foundations that are integral to the entire system's functionality. This entailed setting up the backend server, defining the database structure, and establishing the necessary connections to facilitate data storage and retrieval, ensuring the system's seamless operation.
