Our team started the PulseHR Employee Management System project and moved into a more focused development phase during the second week of the project. Building a solid system foundation was the main priority during this time. This required developing an API, handling data processing, and handling server-side logic in a separate Node.js backend. We also worked on integrating the system with a MySQL database to guarantee effective data retrieval and storage at the same time.

The creation of Express RESTful APIs this week was a noteworthy accomplishment. These APIs facilitate smooth data transactions by acting as a communication link between the front-end and back-end. In order to implement basic CRUD operations and lay the foundation for comprehensive employee data management, it is imperative that RESTful APIs be created.


The backend and database components were integrated seamlessly through collaborative efforts. Setting the foundation for later stages of development, this work highlights how crucial it is to have an integrated and efficient employee management system. Going forward, we will continue to concentrate on polishing these core components and getting ready to add more features in the upcoming weeks.
