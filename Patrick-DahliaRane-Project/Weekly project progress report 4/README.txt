We made great progress in the fourthÂ week of backend development for our PulseHR Employee Management System, especially with regard to tightening up security and improving backend logic. Our focus during this phase has been on improving the efficiency and scalability of the backend codebase. Furthermore, we made a concerted effort to strengthen the security of the system by putting strict measures in place, with a focus on data encryption and secure user authentication protocols. In the future, we hope to improve user authentication capabilities, optimize system performance, and carry out extensive testing to guarantee the robustness and dependability of the system. Furthermore, as part of our quest for backend excellence, we investigated the application of Spring Boot, utilizing its potential to optimize system performance and streamline backend operations.
